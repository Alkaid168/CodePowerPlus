## Limits / 数据来源与局限

- 全部题面、gold 和相关性正负例由代理为测试自编，学习者及提交为模拟数据；没有真实参与者，没有模型预测，也没有教师批准。
- This small authored_fixture dataset validates mechanics, not real learning outcomes or generalization.
- Positive/negative relevance examples were authored for scenarios, not independently assessed; unlisted candidates are treated as non-relevant for hit/MRR.
- Recommendations use fixture gold analyses, so this is an oracle-label ranking experiment and excludes prediction errors.
- Mastery uses only simulated history: latest non-CE result per problem; (1+final AC problem count)/(2+independent problem count) per knowledge ID, reusing the production formula in services/profile.py. These are heuristics, not calibrated learning probabilities.
- Difficulty-only baseline targets 1+4*mean(observed mastery), default 3; the knowledge ranker adds tag weakness on top. Neither is tuned on real outcomes.
- MRR is truncated at k; coverage denominator is the union of all learner-eligible candidates.
- No API, real user, or database is used; no automatic paid prediction calls. Use external predictions to evaluate labels/difficulty.

Per-learner rankings, known mastery and held-out relevance are preserved in `report.json`.
